2026-01-28 20:15:34,"robert.hilton@jefferson.edu","Methodist ICU guide app","Due to the low frequency of rotation for residents in the Methodist ICU, our unit has typically relied on a bulletin board for notices about standard pathways, management policies, and guideline practice patterns. This is both messy, and relies on physically posting things which is not easily updated. Residents often have confusion about “how things are done at methodist.”

We are interested in the value of a phone application which can provide easy guidance to improve our adherence to specific aspects of ICU care.

We are looking for technologically savvy residents who know how to build an application with us. We will also be performing a pre- and post- implementation survey of rotating residents. This has been done in the anesthesia department and could be a project that grows if shown to be valuable.","Pulmonology/Critical Care","2","Abstract","Statistics"
