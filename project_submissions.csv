This is both messy, and relies on physically posting things which is not easily updated. Residents often have confusion about “how things are done at methodist.”

We are interested in the value of a phone application which can provide easy guidance to improve our adherence to specific aspects of ICU care.

We are looking for technologically savvy residents who know how to build an application with us. We will also be performing a pre- and post- implementation survey of rotating residents. This has been done in the anesthesia department and could be a project that grows if shown to be valuable.","Pulmonology/Critical Care","2","Abstract","Statistics"

JMH continues to see a high volume of patients with COPD, with a similarly high rate of readmissions. We are interested in coordinating a fast track inpatient referral process to pulmonary rehab possibly to include inpatient spirometry to improve transition into pulmonary rehab. This will start with a review of COPD admissions, and the frequency of referral to pulmonary rehab, as well as successful enrollments.","Pulmonology/Critical Care","2","Database, Abstract","Chart Review, Literature Review"

This includes approximately 1500 patients, of whom approximately 600 have undergone RHC. I have many questions and hypotheses for the database, but I need help with updating the data and then interrogating the data! I am actively working on updating the registry and would welcome help - you can get involved at a variety of levels depending on your interest and availability.
